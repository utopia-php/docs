description: Our elevation system for creating depth and hierarchy through shadows.

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@components/mdx';

Elevation in our design system creates visual hierarchy through the use of shadows. It helps users understand the relationship between elements and their interaction states.

## Tokens

| Token Name    | Value                         | Usage                             |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `elevation-0` | `none`                        | No shadow, flat elements          |
| `elevation-1` | `0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.05)`  | Subtle elevation for hover states |
| `elevation-2` | `0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)`   | Cards, buttons                    |
| `elevation-3` | `0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)`   | Dropdowns, popovers               |
| `elevation-4` | `0 10px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)` | Modals, dialogs                   |
| `elevation-5` | `0 20px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)` | Maximum elevation                 |

## Usage Guidelines

- Use elevation sparingly to maintain visual hierarchy
- Increase elevation to indicate interactive states
- Consider the context and surrounding elements when choosing elevation levels
- Use higher elevations for elements that should appear closer to the user

## Examples

```css
.card {
	box-shadow: var(--elevation-2);
}

.card:hover {
	box-shadow: var(--elevation-3);
}

.modal {
	box-shadow: var(--elevation-4);
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Consistent Usage**

   - Use the same elevation level for similar components
   - Maintain consistent elevation changes for interaction states

2. **Accessibility**

   - Ensure sufficient contrast between elevated elements
   - Don't rely solely on elevation to convey information

3. **Performance**
   - Be mindful of shadow rendering performance
   - Consider using simpler shadows for mobile devices
