import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@components/mdx';

Our icon system provides a consistent visual language across our applications. We use a curated set of icons that maintain clarity and meaning at various sizes.

## Icon Set

We use [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com/) as our primary icon library, which provides a comprehensive set of icons in multiple weights.

## Size Tokens

| Token Name | Value  | Usage                          |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------------------------ |
| `icon-xs`  | `12px` | Very small UI elements         |
| `icon-sm`  | `16px` | Default size for most contexts |
| `icon-md`  | `20px` | Primary UI elements            |
| `icon-lg`  | `24px` | Featured UI elements           |
| `icon-xl`  | `32px` | Hero sections, marketing       |

## Weight Variants

- Regular (default)
- Light
- Bold
- Fill

## Usage Guidelines

### Implementation

```jsx
import { House, User, Gear } from '@phosphor-icons/react'

// Basic usage
<House size={20} />

// With weight variant
<User size={20} weight="bold" />

// With color
<Gear size={20} color="#5046e4" />
```

### Best Practices

1. **Consistency**

   - Use consistent icon sizes within similar contexts
   - Maintain consistent weight variants within sections
   - Align icons with your typography scale

2. **Accessibility**

   - Always provide aria-labels for icon buttons
   - Ensure sufficient color contrast
   - Use icons to enhance, not replace, text labels

3. **Performance**
   - Import icons individually to reduce bundle size
   - Consider using sprite sheets for frequently used icons

## Icon Guidelines

- Use icons sparingly to avoid visual noise
- Ensure icons are recognizable and meaningful
- Maintain adequate spacing around icons
- Consider touch targets for interactive icons (minimum 44x44px)
- Use consistent colors that align with your color system
