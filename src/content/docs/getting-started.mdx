## Getting Started with Utopia PHP

*Micro PHP libraries for modern applications*

Utopia PHP is a collection of micro libraries designed to help you build high-performance microservice applications with modern PHP. Each library is focused, lightweight, and easy to use. These are the building blocks that help Appwrite serve billions of monthly requests and over 350k backends for web and mobile projects.

## Quick Start

### 1. Choose Your Libraries

Start by selecting the libraries you need for your project. Each library is independent and can be installed separately:

```bash
composer require utopia-php/http
composer require utopia-php/database
composer require utopia-php/cache
```

### 2. Basic HTTP Server

Here's a simple example using the HTTP library:

```php
<?php

require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Utopia\Http\Http;
use Utopia\Http\Request;
use Utopia\Http\Response;

$http = new Http('0.0.0.0', 8080);

$http->get('/', function (Request $request, Response $response) {
    $response->json(['message' => 'Hello from Utopia PHP!']);
});

$http->start();
```

### 3. Add Database Support

```php
<?php

use Utopia\Database\Database;
use Utopia\Database\Document;

$database = new Database();

// Create a collection
$database->createCollection('users');

// Insert a document
$user = $database->createDocument('users', new Document([
    'name' => 'John Doe',
    'email' => 'john@example.com'
]));
```
