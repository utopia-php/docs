The Button component is a versatile UI element used for initiating actions or submitting data in your application. It is one of the most common interactive elements and is designed to be highly customizable to meet different use cases.

<ComponentExample type="single">
	<Button variant="primary" client:load>
		Button
	</Button>
</ComponentExample>

## Overview

A button typically triggers an event when clicked, such as form submissions, navigation, or interactions with other elements in the interface. Our Button component follows the principles of clarity, accessibility, and consistency.

## Usage

The Button component should be used to perform primary or secondary actions within your UI. It is important to choose the correct button style depending on the importance of the action.

<ComponentExample type="variants">
	<Button variant="primary" client:load>
		Button
	</Button>
	<Button variant="secondary" client:load>
		Button
	</Button>
	<Button variant="tertiary" client:load>
		Button
	</Button>
</ComponentExample>

- **Primary buttons:** Use for the most important action on the page or within a section
- **Secondary buttons:** Use for less critical actions or alternative choices
- **Tertiary buttons:** Typically used for actions like "Cancel" or "Reset" that are not the main focus

Each variant has distinct visual styles to ensure the button's purpose is immediately apparent to the user.

```js
// Primary button
<Button variant="primary">Submit</Button>

// Secondary button
<Button variant="secondary">Cancel</Button>

// Tertiary button
<Button variant="tertiary">Learn More</Button>
```

## States

The Button component includes different states to indicate the status of an action:

<ComponentExample type="states">
	<Button variant="primary" client:load>
		Default
	</Button>
	<Button variant="primary" class="hover" client:load>
		Hover
	</Button>
	<Button variant="primary" class="pressed" client:load>
		Pressed
	</Button>
	<Button variant="primary" disabled client:load>
		Disabled
	</Button>
	<Button variant="primary" class="focus" client:load>
		Focus
	</Button>
</ComponentExample>

- **Default:** The button is in its normal state
- **Hover:** When the user hovers over the button
- **Pressed:** When the button is clicked or held down
- **Disabled:** When the button is not interactive
- **Focus:** The focus state is crucial for accessibility and navigation. When a user navigates to the button using the keyboard

```js
// Disabled button example
<Button variant="primary" disabled>
	Submit
</Button>
```
